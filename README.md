A fun and educational quiz about JavaScript output questions. Made with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. Perfect for JavaScript learners.
The project helped me to learn javascript in two ways. first by implementing the logic of the quiz, and second by reading and trying to answer the questions in the quiz.
